# Wuthering Insight

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChristopherKlay/WutheringInsight/refs/heads/main/media/img/banner.jpg)

A tool to quickly analyze your character showcase files powered by OCR (optical character recognition) displaying information that isn't (easily, or at all) available via the game.

[Live Version](https://christopherklay.github.io/WutheringInsight/)

## Features

-   [x] Upload showcases provided by the official Wuthering Waves Discord bot to get a complete overview.
-   [x] No access to the game is required, with absolutely no risk of account restrictions.
-   [x] Echo rating is based on crit values, weighted stats (per character), and even echo value (including roll probability) to help you identify your most replaceable echo.
-   [x] Donâ€™t have access to the bot or just want to quickly check a single echo you obtained? Use manual mode to check the stats for any given character.
-   [x] Export the results (including current settings and filters) as an easily shareable image (optional).
