# Wuthering Insight

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChristopherKlay/WutheringInsight/refs/heads/main/media/img/banner.jpg)

A tool to quickly analyze your character showcase files powered by OCR (optical character recognition) displaying information that isn't (easily, or at all) available via the game.

[Live Version](https://christopherklay.github.io/WutheringInsight/)

## Features

-   [x] Upload showcases provided by the official Wuthering Waves Discord bot and get a complete overview
-   [x] Doesn't require any access to the game, with absolutely no risk of account restrictions
-   [x] Echo rating based on crit values, weighted stats (per character) and even echo value (incl. roll probability) to check your most replaceable echo
-   [x] Don't have access to the bot, or quickly want to check a single echo you got? Use manual mode and check the stats for any given character
-   [x] Export the results (including current settings/filters) as a easily shareable image (optional)
